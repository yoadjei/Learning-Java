## Contributing

Feel free to:
- Add new features to existing projects
- Create new projects following the same style
- Improve comments and explanations
- Fix bugs or optimize code

## Next Steps

After working through these projects, try:
1. Combining multiple projects (e.g., student grades with charts)
2. Adding GUI with JavaFX or Swing
3. Connecting to a real database
4. Building a web version with Spring Boot
5. Creating your own projects from scratch

Happy coding!
